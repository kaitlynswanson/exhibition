	<p><center><b>Interviewer:</b> Kaitlyn Swanson
<b>Interviewee:</b> Diana Vieho<br />
1-30-18<br />
Andrew Daramola <br /><br />
<p>Diana Veiho, a counseling intern here at Da Vinci Communications High School. I attended Loyola Marymount College for my
masters in school counseling, I graduated from Dominguez Hills with my bachelors in sociology and psychology in the year 2016.<br /></p>

<p>When and where were you born?<br /></p>

<p><b>Diana:</b> I was born April 6th, 1984 in Harbor hospital in Torrance, California.</p>

<p>Where did you grow up?</p>

<p><b>Diana:</b>uhmm..first couple of years of my life, I grew up in Inglewood  then when I was two years old I grew up in Hawthorne,<br />
 from Hawthorne I stayed up until I was 22 and then I lived in Paramount for one year.<br /></p>
 
<p><b>Me:</b> How was it like living in Inglewood and Hawthorne?<br /></p>

<p><b>Diana:</b> I loved it. Like this is home.</p>

<p>Was your childhood life? Good?</p>

<p><b>Diana:</b> yeah. I have two sisters and they are older than me so I always had kids around. My dad had eleven brothers and sisters so they are <br />
always someone to play with and my mom was really involve she didn’t work so there was never <br />a time I was alone she would always took us museums and park...stuff like that.</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> Okay ethnic background?</p>

<p><b>Diana:</b> Both of my parents are born in Mexico, um my dad was born in Cali and my mom was born at Guadalajara.<br /></p>

<p><b>Me:</b> Where is your mom family from?<br /></p>

<p><b>Diana:</b>My mom's family is form a ranch somewhere in Mexico I believe at Guadalajara. Um and they moved to actual <br />city when she was older.<br /></p>

<p><b>Me:</b> How is your dad family?<br /></p>

<p><b>Diana:</b> Um my dad family is huge. He has eleven brothers and sisters and he a mom and a dad… all his siblings has kids. So meaning there is a bunch<br />
 a people in my family.</p>
 
<p><b>Me:</b> Have you been to the ranch that they have mention?</p>

<p><b>Diana:</b> No, I have never been.<br /></p>

<p><b>Me:</b> Okay, what is the most important lesson in your life?<br /></p>

<p><b>Diana:</b> Um… the most important lesson I have learned was to let go and let God. Basically I was too controlling of my life and I would try to control <br />
things that I couldn't so it taught me to let go and that's all I have power of. <br />For an example, I was too tired to do homework or whatever because I was
 stressed out that my parents didn’t have money or something so I thought what can I do to change that<br /> so obsessively go get a job but other than that if I couldn’t change
 I wouldn’t worry about it. <br />I was just let whatever has to happen and learn to deal with it later.</p>
 
<p><b>Me:</b> How did you dealt with that? Like leaving everything?</p>

<p><b>Diana:</b> Mmmm… I would say… obsessively for the best thing to do but it has worked out. I can’t control that moments so what’s the point of worrying about it. 
Like example, I had problems at work where my supervisor and I do not get along and there is nothing to do to change the way she is so what I did changed my thinking 
and told myself there is nothing I can do about her but there is a lot I can learn from her. For an example, I learned how not to be like a supervisor like her, like 
how to be more supported for myself if my supervisor isn't giving me what I need.<br /></p>

<p><b>Me:</b> How was your life different than you imagined?<br /></p>

<p><b>Diana:</b> Umm… When I was little I never really thought I was going to be this successful and I didn’t image myself going to college ever.  When I was in high 
school until senior year I guess I will go to college because everyone is doing it. I didn’t see myself getting my master ever you know? So I think that’s different and maybe
 also I loved being the one that helps the family the most of mentally and sometimes money wise. Because my sister didn’t graduate high school so now the time they are stressing
 out so I am the one who can help them like how do I get my high school diploma? They sometimes depend on me but now they have kids so not as often.<br /></p>
 
<p><b>Me:</b> What is in a moment of history?<br /></p>

<p><b>Diana:</b> I think it’s when a colored person got elected so it was ice that we can look up to someone like that.</p>

<p><center>Once done with our interview's, each of us were told to create a map on a website called "Scribble Map". My scribble map shown above was assigned and <br />
created to show the points located, each of which had come upon at somepoint in my interviewee's life, Diana Vieho.<br />
As you may not be able to see clearly, each of these locations were either a building of some purpose, the hospital where she had been born <br />
for example, a town of where she had lived with her family while growing up, a school of which she attended for her education. As well for these<br />
points, each of them have a desription explaning how it came upon her life.</center></p>
