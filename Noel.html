<p><center>Answer the Following Questions:</center></p>

<p>1.  Describe how your layered self-portrait visually represents your top three strengths (from the VIA survey). What were your top three strengths? How did you choose to visually represent these?
 How did you make these decisions?</p>
<p>My top 3 strengths of the VIA survey came out being Judgement, Gratitude, and Fairness. To visually represent these strengths I placed in about 7 images for each that in some way have a or show the meaning
 of whatever that strength is. I made these decisions for the chosen images by simply picking out the best that I thought had an understandable and clear enough representation behind.</p>

<p>2.  Describe how your layered self-portrait visually represents the person that you want to be in 2018. What images did you choose to represent your goals? Justify the choices that you made?</p>
<p>The images I chose represents my goals by having few quotes too each strength and they are quotes that show an example of that specific strength so therefore it represents my goals in  some way 
because it is what i want to reach like that one example.</p>

<p>3.   Talk about the composition of your layered self-portrait. How did you resize images to indicate dominance? How did you decide which images would be more dominant?</p>
<p>By resizing the images in order to indicate dominance was I would erase the outer surroundings of the main idea overall so I can zoom in more putting all attention on the meaning.</p>

<p>4.   Talk about the process of creating your layered self-portrait. What did you learn through the creation of this project deliverable? What did you learn about yourself?</p>
<p>Through the creation of this project deliverable I learned nothing about my self because I had already known this information about me of past experiences.</p>
